    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Vaccine Data Analysis Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective**:\n",
    "   - The main goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new vaccine developed by AliTech by analyzing the health scores of patients before and after vaccination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Null Hypothesis**:\n",
    "   - We defined the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) as stating that the vaccine has no effect on health scores, meaning the average change in health scores before and after vaccination is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Description**:\n",
    "   - The dataset included patient information with columns for Patient ID, Age, Gender, Initial Health Score, and Final Health Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - We calculated the change in health scores by subtracting the initial health scores from the final health scores for each patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Visualization**:\n",
    "   - A box plot was created to visually compare the initial and final health scores, providing insight into the data distribution and potential changes due to the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bootstrapping Analysis**:\n",
    "   - We performed bootstrapping to estimate the distribution of the change in health scores. This involved generating numerous bootstrap samples and calculating the mean change for each sample.\n",
    "   - A 95% confidence interval was calculated from the bootstrapped means to assess whether zero (the null hypothesis mean) was a plausible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Supporting Visualization**:\n",
    "   - A histogram of the bootstrapped means was plotted, illustrating the distribution and including lines for the null hypothesis mean (0) and the confidence interval bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Findings**:\n",
    "   - The bootstrapped mean change in health scores and the corresponding 95% confidence interval were printed to summarize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - Based on the confidence interval, we made a decision regarding the null hypothesis:\n",
    "     - If the interval did not include zero, we rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that the vaccine had a statistically significant positive effect on health scores.\n",
    "     - If the interval included zero, we failed to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Reproducibility**:\n",
    "    - The analysis used `np.random.seed()` to ensure reproducibility of the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- You can further discuss limitations, potential biases, or other factors influencing health scores in your written report. Additional analyses could be performed, such as stratifying by age or gender to assess the vaccine's effectiveness across different demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary encapsulates the key components of your analysis and the logical flow from hypothesis formulation to conclusion. If you need any further elaboration or specific details, feel free to ask!\n",
