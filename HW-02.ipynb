    "Here's a summary of what we accomplished today:\n",

    "1. **Monty Hall Problem Simulation**:\n",
    "   - You provided a Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem, where the player follows the strategy of always switching doors.\n",
    "   - We ran the simulation 100,000 times, and the results showed a winning probability of approximately 66.85%, aligning with the theoretical result of 2/3 when the player switches doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarification on Code**:\n",
    "   - We walked through the second part of your original code, especially focusing on the `try-except` block, which was used to handle errors when attempting to remove `my_door_choice` from the list.\n",
    "   - The `try-except` block ensured that the program wouldn't crash when the player’s initial choice was the winning door.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplified Version of the Simulation**:\n",
    "   - I provided a more streamlined version of the Monty Hall simulation.\n",
    "   - The simplified version uses list comprehensions and avoids the `try-except` block, making the logic clearer and easier to follow.\n",
    "   - We explained each step in the new code, covering the process of choosing doors, revealing a goat, switching, and calculating the probability of winning by switching.\n",

    "### **Extension 1: Using a Sequence of Previous Words (n-grams)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just focusing on the last word, we can use the last *n* words as context to decide the next word. This method is called an **n-gram model**. By using more words in the history, the chatbot can make more informed predictions about the next word, resulting in better responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the code can be extended to consider the last two words (a bi-gram) instead of just one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize the dictionaries for counting word sequences and transitions\n",
    "word_used = dict()  # To count how often each sequence of words appears\n",
    "next_word = dict()  # To store the frequencies of the next words based on a sequence\n",

    "        next_word[current_sequence][next_word_in_sequence] = 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### **What Changed:**\n",
    "- We are now tracking **bi-grams** instead of just single words. This means the chatbot uses the last two words to predict the next word.\n",
    "- `current_sequence` is a tuple of the last two words (like `('the', 'cat')`).\n",
    "- This results in better predictions since it looks at more context instead of just the immediate previous word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extension 2: Visualizing the Markov Chain Structure (with a Diagram)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful extension is to visualize the Markov Chain structure as a **directed graph**. Each word (or sequence of words) is a node, and an arrow from one word to another represents a possible transition, with the thickness of the arrow proportional to the frequency of that transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use a library like `networkx` and `matplotlib` in Python to generate such a diagram. Here's how the visualization code might look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import networkx as nx\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a directed graph\n",
    "G = nx.DiGraph()\n",

    "# Add nodes and edges based on the word transitions\n",
    "for sequence, transitions in next_word.items():\n",
    "    for next_word_in_sequence, count in transitions.items():\n",
    "        # Add an edge from the sequence to the next word with the weight as the count\n",
    "        G.add_edge(' '.join(sequence), next_word_in_sequence, weight=count)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Draw the graph with weights (frequencies)\n",
    "pos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # Position nodes using a force-directed algorithm\n",
    "edges = G.edges(data=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Draw nodes and labels\n",
    "nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=3000, node_color=\"skyblue\", font_size=10, font_weight=\"bold\")\n",
    "# Draw edges with their weights\n",
    "nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels={(u, v): d['weight'] for u, v, d in edges})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the graph\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation of Visualization:**\n",
    "- This graph shows how words (or word sequences) transition to other words.\n",
    "- Each node represents a word or sequence of words.\n",
    "- Each arrow (directed edge) represents a transition from one word/sequence to another.\n",
    "- The thickness or label on the arrows represents the frequency of each transition, giving you insight into how words are likely to follow each other.\n",

    "1. **Analyzed Your Markov Chain Chatbot Code**:\n",
    "   - We started by breaking down your original code, which predicts the next word based on the **previous word**. This was a simple **Markov Chain model** for generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extended the Model with N-grams**:\n",
    "   - We modified the model to use **n-grams**, specifically **bi-grams** (sequences of two words), allowing the chatbot to consider the last two words instead of just one when predicting the next word.\n",
    "   - This provides the chatbot with more context, making the responses more coherent and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualized the Markov Chain**:\n",
    "   - We introduced a method to **visualize the Markov Chain** as a directed graph where nodes represent words (or word sequences) and edges represent transitions between them.\n",
    "   - Using libraries like **`networkx`** and **`matplotlib`**, we can graphically display how words transition, with the thickness of edges representing transition frequencies, helping to better understand and debug the chatbot’s behavior.\n",

    "This extension seems to analyze word sequences (bigrams and trigrams) within a dataset where each word is associated with a \"character.\" The `word_used2C` and `next_word2C` dictionaries track bigrams and trigrams, categorized by characters from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "1. The `characters` variable counts the occurrences of each character name from the `avatar.character` column, after converting it to uppercase and replacing spaces with dots.\n",
    "2. `word_used2C` stores the frequency of each bigram (two-word sequences) for each character.\n",
    "3. `next_word2C` stores trigrams (three-word sequences), where each bigram points to the possible words that can follow it, categorized by character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to make the code cleaner using `defaultdict`, similar to the previous example, which eliminates the need for multiple checks.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preprocess character data from the dataset\n",
    "characters = Counter(\"\\n\" + avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ', '.') + \":\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nested defaultdict for storing bigram and trigram frequencies\n",
    "nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "word_used2C = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))  # Counts bigrams\n",
    "next_word2C = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)))  # Counts trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "character = None  # Initialize character variable\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "    if word in characters:\n",
    "        character = word  # Update character when found in the dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Update bigram counts\n",
    "    bigram = word + ' ' + words[i + 1]\n",
    "    word_used2C[character][bigram] += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Update trigram counts\n",
    "    next_word2C[character][bigram][words[i + 2]] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Using `defaultdict(int)`**: This automatically initializes values for bigrams and trigrams to `0`, avoiding the need for multiple `if` checks.\n",
    "2. **Character Initialization**: `character` is updated only when `word` is found in `characters`.\n",

    "1. **Initial Code**: \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Extended Code**: \n",
    "   - You then extended the initial concept to analyze bigrams and trigrams for characters from a dataset (`avatar.character`), creating two nested dictionaries (`word_used2C` for bigrams and `next_word2C` for trigrams). \n",
    "   - We optimized this further by leveraging `defaultdict` to remove redundant checks and make the code more concise and efficient.\n",
